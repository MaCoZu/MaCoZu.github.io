                    <p>The logistic map is a mathematical model used to describe how populations change over time in
                        a constrained environment. It is particularly famous for demonstrating how simple rules can
                        lead to complex and even chaotic behavior.</p>
                    <p>Populations size $x_{t}$ is is given as a fraction of the maximum population an environment
                        can sustain, called “<em>fraction of carrying capacity</em>”. $R$ is the growth rate, which
                        influences how quickly the population grows.<br />
                        $$x_{n+1}​=Rx_n​(1−x_n​)$$<br />
                        With different values of $R$ the model exhibits population stabilization at a certain size
                        ($1&lt;R&lt;3$), or oscillations and cycles ($3&lt;R&lt;3.57$) and even unpredictable
                        chaotic
                        behavior
                        ($R&lt;3.57$), although the model is deterministically, that is every $x_{t}$ maps to one
                        $x_{t+1}$.</p>
                    <p>Stabilization reflects real-world scenarios where populations grow until they reach a
                        sustainable level. Oscillations and cycles may represent predator-prey dynamics or seasonal
                        population changes. The value or set of values a populations settles into it fluctuates
                        between are called <strong>attractors</strong>, which represent the long-term behavior of
                        the system. </p>

                <p>With high values of $R$ fluctuations become unpredictably chaotic after about 30 iterations.
                    This illustrates how sensitive ecosystems can be to small changes in initial conditions
                    $x_{n}$. It is an example of the <strong>butterfly effect</strong>, a metaphor how tiny
                    things can change the world or how a butterfly flapping its wings can set off a tornado. The
                    concept of trifles becoming earth-shattereing events was around for some time when Edward
                    Lorenz (1917–2008) known as the founder of modern chaos theory, placed it onto a
                    quantitative base.</p>

                <p>Lorenz was a meteorologist and messing around with a computer model of weather patterns in
                    1961 he noticed that very small rounding errors in his simulation compounded to produce
                    large changes in the long-run. The prevailing view at the time was that minor discrepancies
                    in the initial conditions would result in comparable forecast trajectories. When Lorenz was
                    right most weather and other models are garbage, because they’re so “<em>sensitive to
                        initial conditions</em>” that the smallest rounding error in the model will eventually
                    dominate the solution.</p>
                <p>You can look for attractors with $R &lt; 3.57$ and different values of $x_t$, or discover the so
                    called <strong>deterministic chaos</strong> with $R>3.57$. Here changes of $x_t$ in the
                    sixth decimal place generate wildly differing trajectories in the later periods. Even
                    though the trajectory is fully determined by the equation above, the sensitivity to
                    initial conditions means: no matter how accurate our measurements get, no matter how
                    fast our computers become, we will never be able to predict the likelihood the weather
                    or population size beyond a modest time horizon.</p>
