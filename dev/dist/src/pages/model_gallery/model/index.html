                <p>A model is a simplified version of some part or feature of the real world. Models are regularly devised to test a
                    theory. Especially in fields where laboratory experimentation is unfeasible (astronomy, economics) a replication of
                    some real system is examined for its behavior under certain circumstances. Models are always abstractions of reality
                    and consist only of some relevant parts, cardinal properties and few relations between the parts and their temporal
                    dynamics. The simplification is intentional, as it clarifies the sight and accentuates the essentials. The idea of
                    modelling is to define, visualize, simulate, quantify, manipulate, predict real phenomena and through understanding
                    be able to maybe even master nature.</p>
                
                <p>Here we may interject, that an objective selection of parts and properties of reality is questionable. A scientist
                    will tend to build a model that serves her or his implicit presuppositions, deliberate or unwittingly. The choices
                    and assumptions made while creating a model are contingent on the environment the scholar is living in. These musing
                    constitute the philosophical branch of epistemology, which calls our knowledge about the world into question. How
                    can we be sure reality is the way we perceive it? Well, we can test our perceptions and presuppositions with
                    theories and models. But these models will be creatures of the same premises they set out to test.</p>
                
                <p>The above is inherent to knowledge production and not necessarily an impediment to progress. Much of science is a
                    constant update of ideas by many until some breakthrough is reached. With that said, even the crudest model is an
                    invitation to refine, falsify or to tear it apart. As the motto: “all models are wrong, but some are useful”
                    acknowledges.</p>
                
                <p>Model propels science in different ways. First they act as intermediaries between theories and the real world
                    allowing us to test, support or falsify the theories. By isolating and quantifying key information, the mechanics
                    can be described in the language of mathematics. When a group of models comes together to build a system, they can
                    interact via data and math.</p>
                
                <p>A model devised to explain one distinct phenomena may also explain other things, which it had not intended to
                    explain. For example, Maxwell's equations, developed to describe electromagnetism also predicted other forms of
                    radiation which led to the development of wireless communication technologies. Game theory, invented to describe
                    strategic interactions in economics, produced models that have been applied to biology (evolutionary strategies),
                    political science (voting systems), and computer science (algorithm design).</p>
                
                <p>A model also points to relevant data to collect<a id='fn-text-1' href='#fn-bib-1'>$^1$</a>. For instance, radio waves
                    were only sought and found after Maxwell had presented his equations.</p>
                
                <p>Some caution is still advised, as modelling can have surprising consequences, especially in</p>
                <p>relation to humans. Theories and models concerning human behavior will make assumptions, that are scarcely unbiased,
                    and any conclusion will hinge on the assumptions made. This is the above-mentioned circular reasoning inherent in
                    many theories.</p>
                
                <p>Another, more palpable and profound implication of influential social theories, is the transforming effect it has on
                    people. Once we have defined ourselves as economic man and built the iron cage of rationality<a id='fn-text-2'
                        href='#fn-bib-2'>$^2$</a> supporting this view, it becomes difficult to imagine ourselves differently. Moreover,
                    one could argue that the western obsession with rationality has suffocated certain spheres of knowledge that could
                    have been valuable in the ecological crises we are in today.</p>
                
                <p>A related critique refers to false certainties and the building of affirmative models. Climate models, that associate
                    higher levels of CO2 with a boost in crop yields or count on future generation to technically fix climate change,
                    may sooth us but could prove pretty harmful. And the financial crisis of 2008 was a stark warning about the perils
                    of parochial model-think.</p>
                
                <p>Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve when the subprime bubble was brewing, told the House Committee on
                    Oversight and Government Reform in 2008 he is in “a state of shocked disbelief” since the bubble burst. Greenspan
                    said he confided in the “self-interest of lending institutions”, and admitted that he “found a flaw” in his
                    ideology<a id='fn-text-3' href='#fn-bib-3'>$^3$</a>. The ‘maestro’ was referring to his mental and economic models,
                    which underestimated the importance of financial institutions and their inventive products.</p>
                
                <p>The ideology is part of a pervasive belief in self-regulating markets. Joseph Vogel calls this belief oikodizee: the
                    inclination of economist to conceive markets as natural systems that necessarily tend toward an equilibrium state<a
                        id='fn-text-4' href='#fn-bib-4'>$^4$</a>. It is said that economists have a physics envy which made them produce
                    models mimicking cosmic order. While there is nothing wrong with taking physics an example for social systems,
                    problems arise when disciples are blinded by their orthodox models, and it takes a global crisis to make them see
                    again.</p>
                
                <p>When computer scientist took the human brain as a blueprint for their algorithms,</p>
                
                
                <p>they laid the foundations of artificial intelligence.</p>
                
                <p>- modeled after the brain</p>
                <p>- question intelligence and rationality</p>
                <p>- intelligence is adapting to uncertainty</p>
                <p>- AI is reducing uncertainty</p>

                <p>- Humans overcome slow comm with imagination, empathy</p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The economic man is fully rational and maximizes utility while knowing all alternatives. What a flattering
                    description of our species, and it even allows to quantify our behavior. Now we can aggregate and project what
                    people are about to do. This sometimes works, but more often than not, it doesn’t. Psychologists have identified a
                    <a href='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg'>host of *cognitive
                        biases*</a> that dissuade people from making rational choices.</p>
                
                
                <p>What is more interesting is how the proposed view of ourselves as rational, catches up with us. We've embraced
                    capitalism outright when we found out that maximizing isn’t a sustainable strategy. And now we have to renegotiate
                    what is good or bad and what we have to change. But can we trust our judgment after decades of intoxication? The
                    rational rampage also many closed avenues off.</p>

                <p>A model is a simplified version of some excerpt or feature of reality. It illustrates the workings of
                    phenomena by identifying their relevant parts, cardinal properties, relations between the parts and
                    temporal dynamics. Models are instantiations of theories or one concrete aspects of a theory and
                    illuminate its mechanism by carving out the essential building blocks and forces. To model a
                    phenomena is to define, quantify, visualize, simulate an ultimately to understand, predict or even
                    master reality.</p>
                <p>Models help us to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for a phenomenon to occur. They point
                    to the relevant data to collect.<a id="fn-ref-model-before-data" href="#fn-model-before-data"
                        data-tippy-content="Maxwell's electromagnetic theory is a prime example. From his equations the existence of radio waves was deduced. Only then were they sought…and found! (Epstein, 2008)">$^1$</a>
                </p>

                <p>Models serve as intermediaries between theories and the real world. They are used to check, support
                    or falsify theories. A good model may also explain other related phenomena, which it not intended to
                    explain. Models can be aggregated into systems that highlight the relationships and interactions of
                    different models which may unveil unexpected behavior and emergent properties. </p>
                <p>Too simplistic a model may provoke disgust. Take the homo economicus model, shaping economic science,
                    that portrays men as a rational, egoistic, and utility-maximizing creature. Yannis Varoufakis calls
                    him a “<a
                        href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/philosophical-sexism-deters-women-from-economics-by-yanis-varoufakis-2024-03">male
                        chauvinist pig</a>” scaring away women from the discipline and eventually engendering unsound
                    policies. The model is definitely wrong, as the saying goes: “all models are wrong, but some models
                    are useful”. Economist have not abandoned the economic man but rather made little adjustments,
                    indicating his usefulness to them. </p>
