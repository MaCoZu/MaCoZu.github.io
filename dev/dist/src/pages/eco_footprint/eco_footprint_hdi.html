            <p>The global ecological footprint is calculated by assessing the demand placed on Earth's ecosystems by
                measuring the amount of biologically productive land and sea area required to produce the resources
                consumed and to absorb the waste generated by a population. It can be expressed as the number of earths
                a certain way of life would require, if everyone lived the same lifestyle. Earth required is shown in
                the chart above as a measure of sustainability on the y-axis.
            </p>
            <p>Roughly 60% of the world population lives in countries with an ecological deficit. That is to say that a
                population’s ecological footprint exceeds the region’s biocapacity. And if we all lived like those
                countries one world would not be enough to sustain us. 60 countries out of 182 have a way of live the
                earth could sustain. Almost all the sustainable countries belong to the low or lower-middle income
                group, none of them is in the high income realm. Only four of the 60 countries have also a high human
                development. They are: Egypt, Jordan, Moldova, and Tunisia. This is 2.6% of the world's population, that
                lives a sustainable and good life according to the Human Development Index (HDI).</p>

            <h3 id="hdi">Human Development Index</h3>
            <p>The HDI, was introduced by the UN in 1990 to provide a more well-rounded evaluation of human development
                than mere economic statistics did. It measures health, education, and standard of living. Health is
                assessed by life expectancy at birth. Education by the average number of years of school completed by
                adults as well as the number of years of school expected to be completed by children. Standard of living
                is assessed by the gross national income (GNI) per capita. The HDI can provide insights that a single
                measure cannot. If a country with a high GNI has a lower life expectancy and lower educational
                attainment than a country with a lower GNI, there is reason to suspect that human well-being higher
                income country is not sufficiently prioritized.</p>
            <h3 id="ecological-footprint">Ecological Footprint</h3>
            <p>The ecological footprint measures how much nature we use compared to how much we have. Tracking the
                biologically productive land and water area required by an individual, population, or activity to
                produce all the resources it consumes, to house all its infrastructure, and to absorb its waste given
                current technology. Global Footprint Network annually calculates and publishes countries' ecological
                footprints on an <a href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/licenses/">open data platform</a>. When a
                population's ecological footprint exceeds its territory's biocapacity, it runs a deficit, balanced
                either through using biocapacity from elsewhere or local overuse, called 'ecological overshoot'. At the
                global level, deficit and overshoot are identical due to the absence of interplanetary trade. This
                accounting method can be applied across scales, from global to product level, with global overshoot
                serving as an indicator of unsustainability. (<a
