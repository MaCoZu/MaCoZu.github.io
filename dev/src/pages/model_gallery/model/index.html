                    <p>A model is a simplified version of some excerpt or feature of reality. It illustrates the workings of phenomena by identifying their relevant parts, cardinal properties, relations between the parts and temporal dynamics. Models are instantiations of theories or one concrete aspects of a theory and illuminate its mechanism by carving out the essential building blocks and forces. To model a phenomena is to define, quantify, visualize, simulate an ultimately to understand, predict or even master reality.</p> <p>Models help us to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for a phenomenon to occur. They point to the relevant data to collect.<a id="fn-ref-model-before-data" href="#fn-model-before-data" data-tippy-content="Maxwell's electromagnetic theory is a prime example. From his equations the existence of radio waves was deduced. Only then were they sought…and found! (Epstein, 2008)">$^1$</a></p>
                    
                    <p>Models serve as intermediaries between theories and the real world. They are used to check, support or falsify theories. A good model may also explain other related phenomena, which it not intended to explain. Models can be aggregated into systems that highlight the relationships and interactions of different models which may unveil unexpected behavior and emergent properties. </p> <p>Too simplistic a model may provoke disgust. Take the homo economicus model, shaping economic science, that portrays men as a rational, egoistic, and utility-maximizing creature. Yannis Varoufakis calls him a “<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/philosophical-sexism-deters-women-from-economics-by-yanis-varoufakis-2024-03">male chauvinist pig</a>” scaring away women from the discipline and eventually engendering unsound policies. The model is definitely wrong, as the saying goes: “all models are wrong, but some models are useful”. Economist have not abandoned the economic man but rather made little adjustments, indicating his usefulness to them. </p>
