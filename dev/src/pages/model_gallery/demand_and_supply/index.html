            <p>This is arguably the most fundamental model in economics. And presumably anybody has a rough idea of how
                it works: If the price of a good rises, people buy less. And vice versa, when the price falls demand
                grows. Sellers see it the other way around, the higher the price, the more they want to produce and
                sell, less so if the price is low.</p>
            <p>This reasoning is reflected in the two curves for demand and supply. They represent the aggregated demand
                of all individual buyers and at a certain price and the aggregated supply of all sellers, respectively.
            </p>

           

            <p>Economist consider the relationships between supply, demand, and prices to be so universal that they
                declared them laws. </p>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>and the <strong>Law of Supply</strong> says:</p>

                        <p>Other things being equal, when&nbsp;the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the

            <h3 class="mt-8 md:mt-10 text-left font-semibold tracking-wider">Dynamics of price and quantity</h3>
            <p>In the graph you can manipulate the price and see, with the aid of the gray lines, what quantity is demanded by buyers and the quantity supplied by sellers at this price. At the intersection of the two lines the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. This point is called the <em>equilibrium</em> with the corresponding equilibrium price and quantity.</p> <p>As soon as we move away from this mutually satisfactory point there is a discrepancy. In the case of high prices there is more goods supplied then demanded (surplus) and with low prices the quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied (shortage). This gap is shown by the horizontal black line and the exemplary number shows the absolut discrepancy. Where a green number signifies a shortage and red number a surplus. </p> <p>The model suggests that anything else than the equilibrium is inefficient and that the market forces will steer demand and supply towards the equilibrium. Under the customary neoclassical assumptions which we’ll discuss further down, the differences of demand and supply are settled as follows. </p> <p>In case of a <em>surplus</em>, suppliers are unable to sell all they want at the going price and respond by cutting their prices. Falling prices, in turn, increase the quantity demanded and decrease the quantity supplied. </p> <p>When a <em>shortage</em> occurs, buyers are sort of desperate to get the goods, and suppliers can respond by raising their prices without losing sales. These price increases cause the quantity demanded to fall and the quantity supplied to rise.</p> <p>Thus, if we start at a high or low price, collective actions of market participants pushes the price and quantity towards the equilibrium. Again, economist think of this dynamic as so pervasive that they coined it the <em>Law of supply and demand</em>. </p>

            <h3 class="mt-8 md:mt-10 text-left font-semibold tracking-wider">Shifts in supply and demand</h3>

            <p>Up until now we’ve only discussed movements along the curves, not shifts of the curves itself. That’s because we have started with a fixed set of demand and supply curves and considered only price changes that indirectly prompt an antagonistic price pressure. Shifts of the curves, however, happen when demand or supply change due to factors other than price.</p> <p>The electricity market is a case in point. As electricity demanded increases during peak hours, the price rises, and producers ramp up energy production. When energy demand decreases, usually at night, the price falls, and production is wound down. So much for movements along fixed curves. </p> <p>A <em>shift of the demand curve</em> may occur when the adoption of electric vehicles or heat pumps induces higher demand at all price levels. That shifts the demand curves to the right. Energy efficiency measures or economic downturns can shift the demand curve left, indicating lower overall demand.</p> <p>A <em>shift of the supply curve</em> changes energy supply on every price level. Renewables regularly shift the supply curve to the right, when wind or solar generation is high, prices fall and can even become negative when excess energy strains the electricity grid. The supply curve shifts left, if there's an unexpected outage of renewable sources or increased costs due to (trade) wars and other unforeseen events. </p> <p>Maybe you also noticed the slight shift in wording. Movements along the curve lead to “changes in the quantity” supplied or demanded, while a shift of the curves entails a “change in supply,” or a “change in demand.”</p>

            <h3 class="mt-8 md:mt-10 text-left font-semibold tracking-wider">Model assumptions</h3>

            <p>The model is in fact the centerpiece of neoclassical economics, the dominant school of economic thought since the 1950s. And it would be remiss, not to talk about the bold assumptions the neoclassical theory summons, to prop up the model.</p> <p>Price taking is part of the <em>competitive market assumption</em>. A competitive market has two features. First that buyers and sellers are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price, they just have to accept it. And secondly, that goods offered are all the same so that price is the only variable in the competition.</p> <p>Furthermore, the model assumes the good in question is a <em>normal good</em>. Normal goods experience an increase in demand with a rise in income. Most goods are normal, like energy, but you can contrast them with <em>inferior goods</em>, which are given up when incomes rises. An example of an inferior good are bus rides. As your income rises, you are less likely to take the bus and rather take a cab or buy a car.</p> <p>The above is buttressed by the usual neoclassical assumptions of rational, utility-maximizing, and perfectly informed individuals. Those may be the most questionable assumptions of the lot. Scientists have demonstrated how people often act with bounded rationality or irrationality, and have a host of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a>. Utility maximization is highly useful in quantifying choices and while often equated with selfishness, utility can encompass the common good and altruism. But the concept hinges on rationality and is fraught with its problems. As to perfect information, an approximation can be claimed for some markets and firms, but it's still unrealistic, much more so for individuals with all kinds of temporal and cognitive constraints.</p> <p>As is the case for most simple models, we have examined the mechanics of price and quantity while fixing every other variable. This is normally indicated by the Latin phrase <em>ceteris paribus</em>, meaning <em>all else being equal</em>.</p>
