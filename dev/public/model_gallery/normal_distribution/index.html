                    <p>All kinds of variables in natural and social sciences are (approximately) normally
                        distributed. Height, birth weight, reading ability, job satisfaction, or test scores are
                        just a few examples of such variables. Because normally distributed variables are so common,
                        many statistical tests are designed for them.</p>
                    <p>In a normal distribution data is clustered in the middle and tapering off as they go further
                        away from the center, forming a bell shaped curve. Such a bell shaped curve has very
                        convenient characteristics. Its measures of central tendency – mean, median, and mode – fall
                        in one place. This place splits the dataset cleanly in the middle where half of the values
                        fall below and the other half above the mean. </p>

                <p>When we know the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$, which is the average amount by
                    which observations deviate on either side from the mean, we can immediately tell that 68% of
                    your observations will fall within the range of two standard deviations centered at $\mu$.
                    Provided that the variables are independent and have limited variance. 95% of the data lies
                    within four standard deviations and 99.7% within six $\sigma$ above $\mu$. That is two or three
                    standard deviations below and above the mean. This is called the $\mathbf{68-95-99.7}$ rule or
                    <strong>empirical rule</strong> and if you have $\mu=100$ and $\sigma=15$ you know instantly
                    that 95% of your data points will be found in the range $[70, 130]$.
                </p>

                <p>In business companies try to reduce the deviation, of some critical parts or services, from their
                    perfect quality to a minimum. In terms of the normal distribution, they strive to make the range
                    of variability ($\sigma$) around $\mu$ (perfect quality) as small as possible. </p>
                <p>For example Motorola aspires to improve its manufacturing and business processes, through quality
                    control that defects only happen in 3.4 per million opportunities. The methods to achieve this
                    goal, where coined <strong>Six Sigma</strong> and are now widely implemented by other companies.
                    Sigma is the name of the symbol $\sigma$ for standard deviations, and the goal is to make
                    $\sigma$, so small that any product, within six standard deviations to both sides of the mean
                    (prefect quality) can be rendered good enough.</p>

                <p>Normal distributions can be applied even to variables that are not normally distributed, with the
                    help of the <strong>central limit theorem (CLT).</strong> The CLT says that when you repeatedly
                    sample from independent and identically distributed (other than normally distributed) random
                    variables, and take the arithmetic mean of every sample, these sample means will closely
                    approximate a normal distribution. Thereby statistical methods that work for normal
                    distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions.</p>
                <p>Once you have $\mu$ and $\sigma$ you can find the probability of any data point $x$ to appear in
                    the distribution with the help of the <strong>Probability Density Function (PDF)</strong>. But
                    more commonly we’ll ask, how likely is it to see values below or above some point $x$, and the
                    <strong>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)</strong> answers this question.
                </p>
                <p>Furthermore any normal distribution can be simplified into a standardized form with $\mu=0$ and
                    $\sigma=1$. It can also be said that every normal distribution is a version of the standard
                    normal distribution, whose domain has been stretched by $\sigma$ and shifted by $\mu$. By
                    playing with the interactive graph, you can inspect the form of some normal distributions with
                    different $\mu$ and $\sigma$ or visualize the effects of the transformation from normal to
                    standard normal.</p>

                    <p>
                        Once you have a standard normal distribution you’re looking for the probabilities of
                        $\mathbf{z}$-<strong>scores</strong>, which are nothing else than standardized $x$
                        observations. <br />
                        $$z=(\frac{{x - \mu}}{{\sigma}})$$
                        For a dataset with a mean $\mu_x = 5.0$ and standard deviation $\sigma_x=3.09$, you can see
                        the $x$ values and their corresponding $z$-scores in the table.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After the standardization, the mean of $x$ corresponds with a $z$-score $= 0$. Each
                        $z$-score
                        is associated with a probability, or $\mathbf{p}$<strong>-value</strong>, that tells you the
                        likelihood of values occurring below that $z$-score: <br /> $P(x\leqslant 8) =P(z\leqslant
                        0.97) =0.83\%$.<br />
