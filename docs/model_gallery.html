                        <p>The <strong>Schelling Model of Segregation</strong> explains how individual preferences can
                            lead to large-scale patterns in society. It was developed by economist Thomas Schelling in
                            the 1970s to demonstrate how even a mild inclination to live next to similar neighbors can
                            lead to significant segregation. </p>
                        <p>We can model segregation on a grid, where each field stands for a person with eight
                            neighbors. This person looks at her immediate neighbors and decides about leaving or staying
                            in the neighborhood, according to her preference of neighbors that are alike. For example,
                            she might prefer 30% of her neighbors to be her type, otherwise she’ll move. </p>
                        <p>If she moves this could induce others to leave the neighborhood and eventually trigger a
                            cascade of relocations of a certain type of people to new places that suit their preference.
                            This process might easily lead to a situation, where neighborhoods are more homogeneous than
                            anybody wished for. </p>

                    <p>The model demonstrates how narrow individual decisions can kick off widespread phenomena or how a
                        whole emerges that is more than the sum of its parts.</p>
                    <p>To measure segregation we can calculate the index of dissimilarity. It ranges between zero, or no
                        dissimilarity, and 1, or complete separation of each type from the other. $$D = \frac{1}{2}
                        \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{a_i}{A} - \frac{b_i}{B} \right|$$</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>$n$ = Number of neighborhoods</li>
                        <li>$a_i$ = Population of group A in neighborhood $i$</li>
                        <li>$b_i$ = Population of group B in neighborhood $i$</li>
                        <li>$A$ = Total population of group A across all neighborhoods</li>
                        <li>$B$ = Total population of group B across all neighborhoods</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Dissimilarity is the most widely used measure of evenness. Conceptually it is comparing the
                        composition of neighborhoods to the proportion of different groups in the overall metropolitan
                        area. If the single neighborhoods have the same composition as the entire area the index is
                        close to zero. While a value close to 1 means high segregation (one group is concentrated in
                        certain neighborhoods). </p>
                    <p>As people are moving they’re reducing the unhappiness with their neighbors. This is measured as
                        the percentage of people whose preference of similar neighbors is met. </p>
                    <p>More <strong>Measures of Evenness</strong> like the dissimilarity index compare the spatial
                        distributions of different groups.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>Gini coefficient</strong> captures overall inequality between areas, taking into
                            account how unevenly groups are spread out <em>across the entire region</em>. </li>
                        <li><strong>Entropy</strong> captures how mixed neighborhoods are, as opposed to overall group
                            separation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Measures of Exposure</strong> measures the degree of potential contact between the
                        minority and majority groups and thus the “experiences” segregation by the minority.
                        <strong>Interaction</strong> means the exposure of minority to members of the majority group,
                        while <strong>Isolation</strong> is the extent to which the minority sticks among themselves,
                        owing to the circumstances. <strong>Concentration</strong> is measured of how much space is
                        occupied by a group. Minority groups of the same relative size occupying less space would be
                        considered more concentrated and consequently more segregated. Furthermore,
                        <strong>Centralization</strong> measures location of groups relative to a city center and
                        <strong>Clustering</strong> examines adjacency of similar groups. <a

                    <p>As to the performance of our tool, the first question we might ask is “<em>how many correct
                            predictions did we get overall</em>?”. The <strong>Accuracy</strong> measure answers this
                        question as the percentage of correct predictions out of all instances. But accuracy has a
                        problem with imbalanced datasets, consider data with $95$ infected and $5$ non-infected samples,
                        our test could classify all samples as infected and still boast an accuracy of $95\%$.</p>
                    <p>You could also claim that the test recognized $100\%$ of the infections, and the corresponding
                        measure is <strong>Sensitivity</strong> (aka <strong>Recall</strong>), which is the proportion
                        of correctly predicted positives out of all actual positive instances. Sensitivity warns you
                        about false-negatives but not about false-positives.</p>
                    <p>But what if the treatment of the infection is very dangerous and you can’t afford to detect
                        infections that are not actually there? Then you want to look at <strong>Specificity</strong>,
                        which measures the proportion of correctly predicted negative instances out of all actual
                        negative instances. And the test above with high accuracy and even higher sensitivity renders
                        useless, since it spotted $0\%$ of the non-infected (negative) samples.</p>
                    <p>Another measure called <strong>Precision</strong> tells you “<em>how many of the cases predicted
                            as positive where actually positive</em>”. Precision is interesting if false-positives are
                        costly. While Precision and Specificity help us avoid false-positives they hold no information
                        of false-negatives and you have to look at Sensitivity if you worry about them.</p>
                    <p>Since all those measure have flaws there is measures compounded from the ones above. The
                        <strong>$\mathbf{F_1}$-score</strong> is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity and
                        represents their impact evenly. It gives you an overall assessment of the tool's performance
                        even with imbalanced data. But since precision and sensitivity are symmetrically weighted the
                        $F_1$-score is sometimes further adjusted with different weights attached to precision and/or
                        sensitivity befitting the purpose of your test. Moreover the $F_1$-score ignores true-negatives
                        something <strong>Youden's J statistic</strong> corrects by combining sensitivity and
                        specificity. Tests with the same $J$-value give the same proportion of total misclassified
                        results. But Youden's J doesn’t tell you in which category the the misclassifications happen, as
                        very different values of sensitivity or specificity may yield the same $J$-value. One measure
                        that is considered suitable even for very imbalanced data is <strong>Matthews Correlation
                            Coefficient (MCC)</strong>. The coefficient is equivalent to the chi-square statistic for a
                        $2\times2$ contingency table and produces a high score only if the predictions obtained good
                        results in all of the four categories of the confusion matrix proportionally both to the size of
                        positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since this is all very confusing you should play with the interactive matrix, test the edge cases
                        and the behaviour of the measures until you have a precise and accurate understanding of the
                        specifics of this sensitive concept. </p>

                        <p>The logistic growth is a common model used to describe population growth. Scholars have put
                            Thomas Malthus ideas about demography in a simple formula that captures the basic assumption
                            that humanity, with higher quality of life, will grow exponentially until food production
                            hits a limit and population size will stagnate at a sustainable level. Today we know that a
                            long lifespan and low mortality
                            goes hand in hand with low fertility. Malthus was wrong concerning humans but the model is
                            still useful for all kinds of problems where resources are limited.</p>
                        <p>In the model the current population $N$, instead of just growing at a certain rate $r$ at
                            each time step $t$, is faced with a resource limit called carrying capacity $K$, which is
                            the maximum of individuals the environment can sustain indefinitely. <br />
                            $$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right)$$<br />
                            Every time the population size $N$ increases, $N$ is shrinking the factor in parentheses and
                            thereby slowing down population growth. The larger $N$ becomes the slower it will grow in
                            the next iteration until $N=K$. When the factor in parentheses is zero population size
                            reached a plateau in the carrying capacity $K$. This trajectory produces the typical
                            S-shaped curve of the logistic function, initially soaring and eventually flatting out.

                        <p>The logistic map is a mathematical model used to describe how populations change over time in
                            a constrained environment. It is particularly famous for demonstrating how simple rules can
                            lead to complex and even chaotic behavior.</p>
                        <p>Populations size $x_{t}$ is is given as a fraction of the maximum population an environment
                            can sustain, called “<em>fraction of carrying capacity</em>”. $R$ is the growth rate, which
                            influences how quickly the population grows.<br />
                            $$x_{n+1}​=Rx_n​(1−x_n​)$$<br />
                            With different values of $R$ the model exhibits population stabilization at a certain size
                            ($1&lt;R&lt;3$), or oscillations and cycles ($3&lt;R&lt;3.57$) and even unpredictable

                        <p>Stabilization reflects real-world scenarios where populations grow until they reach a

                    <p>Lorenz was a meteorologist and messing around with a computer model of weather patterns in
                        1961 he noticed that very small rounding errors in his simulation compounded to produce
                        large changes in the long-run. The prevailing view at the time was that minor discrepancies
                        in the initial conditions would result in comparable forecast trajectories. When Lorenz was
                        right most weather and other models are garbage, because they’re so “<em>sensitive to
                            initial conditions</em>” that the smallest rounding error in the model will eventually
                        dominate the solution.</p>
                    <p>You can look for attractors with $R &lt; 3.57$ and different values of $x_t$, or discover the so
                        called <strong>deterministic chaos</strong> with $R>3.57$. Here changes of $x_t$ in the
                        sixth decimal place generate wildly differing trajectories in the later periods. Even
                        though the trajectory is fully determined by the equation above, the sensitivity to
                        initial conditions means: no matter how accurate our measurements get, no matter how

                    <p>When we know the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$, which is the average amount by
                        which observations deviate on either side from the mean, we can immediately tell that 68% of
                        your observations will fall within the range of two standard deviations centered at $\mu$.
                        Provided that the variables are independent and have limited variance. 95% of the data lies
                        within four standard deviations and 99.7% within six $\sigma$ above $\mu$. That is two or three
                        standard deviations below and above the mean. This is called the $\mathbf{68-95-99.7}$ rule or
                        <strong>empirical rule</strong> and if you have $\mu=100$ and $\sigma=15$ you know instantly
                        that 95% of your data points will be found in the range $[70, 130]$.
                    </p>

                    <p>In business companies try to reduce the deviation, of some critical parts or services, from their
                        perfect quality to a minimum. In terms of the normal distribution, they strive to make the range
                        of variability ($\sigma$) around $\mu$ (perfect quality) as small as possible. </p>
                    <p>For example Motorola aspires to improve its manufacturing and business processes, through quality
                        control that defects only happen in 3.4 per million opportunities. The methods to achieve this
                        goal, where coined <strong>Six Sigma</strong> and are now widely implemented by other companies.
                        Sigma is the name of the symbol $\sigma$ for standard deviations, and the goal is to make
                        $\sigma$, so small that any product, within six standard deviations to both sides of the mean
                        (prefect quality) can be rendered good enough.</p>

                    <p>Normal distributions can be applied even to variables that are not normally distributed, with the
                        help of the <strong>central limit theorem (CLT).</strong> The CLT says that when you repeatedly
                        sample from independent and identically distributed (other than normally distributed) random
                        variables, and take the arithmetic mean of every sample, these sample means will closely
                        approximate a normal distribution. Thereby statistical methods that work for normal
                        distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions.</p>
                    <p>Once you have $\mu$ and $\sigma$ you can find the probability of any data point $x$ to appear in
                        the distribution with the help of the <strong>Probability Density Function (PDF)</strong>. But
                        more commonly we’ll ask, how likely is it to see values below or above some point $x$, and the
                        <strong>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)</strong> answers this question.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore any normal distribution can be simplified into a standardized form with $\mu=0$ and
                        $\sigma=1$. It can also be said that every normal distribution is a version of the standard
                        normal distribution, whose domain has been stretched by $\sigma$ and shifted by $\mu$. By
                        playing with the interactive graph, you can inspect the form of some normal distributions with
                        different $\mu$ and $\sigma$ or visualize the effects of the transformation from normal to
                        standard normal.</p>

                        <p>Once you have a standard normal distribution you’re looking for the probabilities of
                            $\mathbf{z}$-<strong>scores</strong>, which are nothing else then standardized $x$
                            observations. <br />
                            $$z=(\frac{{x - \mu}}{{\sigma}})$$
                            For a dataset with a mean $\mu_x = 5.0$ and standard deviation $\sigma_x=3.09$, you can see
                            the $x$ values and their corresponding $z$-scores in the table.</p>

                        <p>After the standardization the mean of $x$ corresponds with a $z$-score $= 0$. Each $z$-score
                            is associated with a probability, or $\mathbf{p}$<strong>-value</strong>, that tells you the
                            likelihood of values occurring below that $z$-score: <br /> $P(x\leqslant 8) =P(z\leqslant
                            0.97) =0.83\%$.<br /> With the p-values you can also determine how likely it is that random
                            variable in the distribution is greater than 10:<br /> $P(x\geqslant 10)=P(z\geqslant 1.62)
                            \\ = (1-0.95)=0.05\%$ <br /> or the probability of a variable greater than 2 but below 10:
                            <br /> $P(2\leqslant x \leqslant 10) \\ = (0.95 - 0.166)=0.78\%$
