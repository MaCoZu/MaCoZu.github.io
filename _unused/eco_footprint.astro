                The global ecological footprint is calculated by assessing the
                demand placed on Earth's ecosystems by measuring the amount of
                biologically productive land and sea area required to produce
                the resources consumed and to absorb the waste generated by a
                population. It can be expressed as the number of earths a
                certain way of life would require, if everyone lived the same
                lifestyle. Earth required is shown in the chart above as a
                measure of sustainability on the y-axis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Roughly 60% of the world population lives in countries with an
                ecological deficit. That is to say that a population’s
                ecological footprint exceeds the region’s biocapacity. And if we
                all lived like those countries one world would not be enough to
                sustain us. 60 countries out of 182 have a way of live the earth
                could sustain. Almost all the sustainable countries belong to
                the low or lower-middle income group, none of them is in the
                high income realm. Only four of the 60 countries have also a
                high human development. They are: Egypt, Jordan, Moldova, and
                Tunisia. This is 2.6% of the world's population, that lives a
                sustainable and good life according to the Human Development
                Index (HDI).

            <h3 id="hdi">Human Development Index</h3>
            <p>
                The HDI, was introduced by the UN in 1990 to provide a more
                well-rounded evaluation of human development than mere economic
                statistics did. It measures health, education, and standard of
                living. Health is assessed by life expectancy at birth.
                Education by the average number of years of school completed by
                adults as well as the number of years of school expected to be
                completed by children. Standard of living is assessed by the
                gross national income (GNI) per capita. The HDI can provide
                insights that a single measure cannot. If a country with a high
                GNI has a lower life expectancy and lower educational attainment
                than a country with a lower GNI, there is reason to suspect that
                human well-being higher income country is not sufficiently
                prioritized.

            <h3 id="ecological-footprint">Ecological Footprint</h3>
            <p>
                The ecological footprint measures how much nature we use
                compared to how much we have. Tracking the biologically
                productive land and water area required by an individual,
                population, or activity to produce all the resources it
                consumes, to house all its infrastructure, and to absorb its
                waste given current technology. Global Footprint Network
                annually calculates and publishes countries' ecological
                footprints on an <a
                    href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/licenses/"
                    >open data platform</a
                >. When a population's ecological footprint exceeds its
                territory's biocapacity, it runs a deficit, balanced either
                through using biocapacity from elsewhere or local overuse,
                called 'ecological overshoot'. At the global level, deficit and
                overshoot are identical due to the absence of interplanetary
                trade. This accounting method can be applied across scales, from
                global to product level, with global overshoot serving as an
                indicator of unsustainability. (<a
