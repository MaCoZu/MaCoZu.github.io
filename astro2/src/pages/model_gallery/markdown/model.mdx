# Model
A model is a simplified version of some part or feature of the real world. Models are regularly devised to test a theory. Especially in fields where laboratory experimentation is impossible or unfeasible (astronomy, social science) a replication of some real system facilitates the study of its mechanisms. 

Due to the limited capacity of the mind, every way of understanding is a piecewise process. Modern science is just more rigorous in dissecting reality, cataloging explanations, inventing new methods of inquiry and constantly updating its methods and explanations. Modeling is thus as much a way of compartmentalizing as an attempt to bring the parts into reasonable relations.

Models are abstractions of reality consisting of some relevant parts, cardinal properties, and temporal dynamics that serve the inquiry. The mechanics of a model's internal elements are often described in the language of mathematics. An ensemble of models can form a system of interacting models. In a system many models communicate via data, transmitting information, triggering another process et cetera, much like a computer program. But the emphasis of a single model is on its separate workings, the single function of a bigger program, so to speak.

The concomitant reductionism of modeling can be ludicrous but has also many proven advantages, here are just a few listed:

- Models help explain by simplifying, visualizing and suggesting analogies. 
- They illuminate core dynamics and trade-offs. 
- They reveal efficiencies, uncertainties and can constrain the possible outcomes to plausible ranges. 
- Models also guide data collection and facilitate the discovery of new questions by testing prevailing theories in light of new observations. 
- They train practitioners scientific habit of mind and sometimes expose the apparently simple as complex and vice versa. 
- Models provide particularly social scientists with a means of educating citizens or officials to sober the public discourse. 
- Especially in times of crisis, models can offer and explain timely options for action (Epstein, 2008).

We may interject, that no selection of parts and properties of reality will ever be objective. A scientist tends to build a model that serves her or his implicit presuppositions, deliberate or unwittingly. Thomas Kuhn (1970) argued that scientific research and thoughts are defined by “paradigms,” conceptual world-views, that consist of formal theories and trusted methods. Researchers extend the prevalent line of thought until the accumulation of inconsistencies triggers an intellectual crisis followed by a paradigm shift. Paul Feyerabend argued – more audacious – in 1975 that breakthroughs often came about through simple trial and error or even by mistakes and chance occurrences (Feyerabend & Hacking, 2010). 

The above does not dismiss the use of models, though. Whether we work in paradigms or wait for a blessing in disguise, we always benefit from  scaffolding our ideas. Even the crudest model is an invitation to refine, repurpose, keep it for another day or throw it in the dustbin. Essentially it assists us until we found something better, as the motto: “all models are wrong, but some are useful” acknowledges.

In the social science, the studied object is a moving target, because social knowledge filters back into society and potentially alters the context itself. This social reflexivity is unique to the humanities and has some curious effects (Giddens and Sutton, 2014). Consider the model of the “homo oeconomicus” that pervades neoclassical economics. Adam Smith (1776) described how a man “by pursuing his own interest […] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.” This notion subsequently evolved into an analytical tool of rational, self-interested utility maximizers. With this “pleasure machine” as Edgeworth called him (Bee & Desmarais-Tremblay, 2023), men’s choices in the economic context, could be studied with mathematical precision, e.g. when prices rise the rational actor buys less. 

The homo oeconomicus model was highly influential, it left a mark on the design of many institutions and thereby on the perception of ourselves as rational beings. To be sure, the model was controversial from the get-go, and kicked-off the mathematization of economics and its divorce from political, social, historical science but it instilled logical rigor into the study of market behavior (ibid.). More recently, the model's was challenged when psychology presented a host of human tendencies to act irrational (cognitive biases).

Nevertheless, the financial crisis of 2008 showed how entrenched homo oeconomicus was in the minds of decision makers. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the FED when the subprime bubble was brewing, said he was in “a state of shocked disbelief” once the bubble burst. He has confided in the “self-interest of lending institutions”, and admitted that he “found a flaw” in his ideology (Andrews, 2008). The ‘maestro’ was referring to his assumptions of rational actors and efficient markets, whereupon models were built that ignored banks and debt.

In the aftermath of the crisis, the paradigm of self-regulating markets quivered but was far from shifting. Joseph Vogl (2015) dubs this belief in markets oikodizee, which conceives markets as some kind of natural systems that necessarily tend toward an equilibrium state. While there is nothing wrong with taking nature as an example for social systems, problems arise when disciples are so besotted with their beautiful models that it takes a global crisis to see the flaws.

Artificial intelligence is a good example of transferring a biological concept into technology. Neural nets were inspired by the computational characteristics of the brain, and in turn AI’s practical findings gave neuroscientists new ideas about the workings of the mind, which remains enigmatic (Ford, 2018). AI also rekindled an old debate about the nature of intelligence. Some researchers deem it misleading to call machines intelligent. Machines are able to do marvelous things employing advanced statistics and computing power on mountains of data, but they lack imagination, empathy and are – by definition – confined to the quantifiable (Lawrence, 2024). Data guzzling, probability crunching, speaking machines are the epitome of homo oeconomicus.
