            <section>
                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Most of us have come across a scatter plot that displays a series of observations on
                    a Cartesian coordinate system where the two dimensions ($x$ and $y$) represent features of our
                    interest. Despite its simplicity, a scatter plot offers valuable insights. At a glance, we can
                    determine the range of values, clusters, and outliers. Often, a likely association between the
                    two features becomes apparent, and we can even imagine a line that models and extends
                    the general trend the scatter plot points out.
                </p>

                <p>Whether you're attempting to find a third point by interpolating linearly between two
                    known points or using a complex neural network for prediction, the concept of regression
                    is always present in the background. This article will work out the regression line from a
                    two-dimensional scatter plot in an intuitive way. Once we have a firm understanding of this process
                    more advanced concepts will be easier to grasp. </p>

                <h2 id="graph of averages">Graph of Averages</h2>
                <p>
                    In the scatter plot above showing the height and weight of 18-year-old persons, you
                    might have spotted a trend and a possible line describing the cloud of dots. With a simple trick,
                    we can fabricate a satisfyingly accurate line. Namely, we can group our observations along the
                    $x$-axis, calculate the group averages $\bar y_i$, map them on the cloud, and draw a line through
                    them, voilà, there is our <b>graph of averages</b>.
                </p>

                <figure class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
                    <div>
                        <iframe src="plots/graph_of_avg.html" title="Simple Scatter Plot" height="500" width="700"
                            scrolling="no" allowfullscreen loading="lazy" seamless></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <figcaption class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
                        Change the number of groups to see how the Graph of Averages reacts.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The information of the scatter was condensed into a few dots. As shown in the plotted
                    graph, larger groups yield a smoother curve but sacrifice a lot of information. On the other hand,
                    smaller groups
                    preserve more information, making the graph more sensitive to variations in the data.
                    This is
                    commonly referred to as the bias-variance trade-off or generalization versus overfitting
                    problem
                    when assessing (regression) models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the graph of averages may seem like a reasonable summarization of the relationship
                    between the
                    variables, it is essentially just a series of dots connected by a line without any
                    functional
                    expression. To construct a function for this graph, one would have to piece it together,
                    line by
                    line, from dot to dot. If we were to extract an estimate $\hat{y}$ from this
                    hypothetical graph, it
                    would require a linear interpolation along the line of the relevant $x$ segment of that
                    graph, which
                    is not what we're looking for.

                <h2 id="SD Line">Standard Deviation Line</h2>
                <p>
                    Another method to summarize the information stored in a scatter plot is by finding the
                    averages of
                    your variables and their standard deviations $s_{x}$ and $s_y$. The two averages mark
                    the <em>point
                        of
                        averages</em> ($\bar{x}, \bar{y}$), which sits in the middle of the cloud of
                    observations. The
                    standard
                    deviation is the most commonly used measure of the spread and is equal to the square
                    root of the
                    variance $s^2$. Often you'll see variance written like this $\sigma^2$ and standard
                    deviation as
                    $\sigma$ which signify population parameters, that describe the whole population.
                    Normally, however,
                    only a sample is available, and measures obtained from samples are called (sample)
                    statistics.
                    Henceforth, I will refer to sample statistics and use their symbols since we usually
                    work with
                    sample data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The standard deviation of $X$ can be thought of as a “typical” distance of the
                    observations $x_i$
                    from its mean, $\bar{x}$. Like the variance, the standard deviation is always a positive
                    number and
                    penalizes large deviations from the mean by squaring the errors.

                    $$s_{x} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

                    The point of averages ($\bar{x}, \bar{y}$) and the standard deviations $s_{x}$ and $s_y$
                    help us
                    understand where the middle of all observations lies and what the typical deviation from
                    that point
                    is. By starting from the point of averages, we can draw a line that has a slope of
                    $\frac{s_y}{s_x}$. Each step of one $s_x$ (typical deviation from $\bar{x}$) along the
                    x-axis is
                    then associated with one step of $s_y$ (typical deviation from $\bar{y}$) on the
                    $y$-axis. This line
                    is referred to as the standard deviation line (or <em>SD Line</em> for short).
                </p>

                <figure class="flex justify-center items-center">
                    <div>
                        <img src="img/sd_new.png" alt="SD Line">
                    </div>
                    <figcaption class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>But this is a pretty rough measure. Remember that standard deviation is the average
                    deviation
                    from the mean and is calculated independently from the other variable. By combining the
                    two
                    standard deviations in a slope we only get a very general sense of the joint behavior of
                    the
                    two variables.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, the direction of the line is missing. In the plot above I have identified a
                    positive correlation with a view to the scatter plot and drawn SD Line accordingly. But
                    If
                    the actual line was downward-sloping, the ratio $\frac{s_y}{s_x}$ would still be
                    positive,
                    as the standard deviations are always positive. In any way, we would like to have
                    mathematical proof of the correlation and its direction.
                </p>
                <p>The correlation coefficient will help us to gain a more detailed understanding of the
                    joint
                    movement of the variables and to quantify the direction of the correlation.

                    indicates the linear relationship between two observed phenomena. This coefficient is
                    unitless, allowing the examination of a relationship between values that cannot be
                    expressed
                    in the same units, such as height and weight.

                <p>
                    The correlation coefficient, $r$, measures the strength and direction of the linear
                    relationship between two variables. It takes values between $-1$ and $1$, where the sign
                    indicates the direction of the relationship and the number indicates the strength of the
                    association. A positive $r$ value means that as one variable increases, the other also
                    increases, while a negative $r$ value means that as one variable increases, the other
                    decreases.

                <p>
                    The limitation to linear relationships means that Pearson's correlation coefficient
                    would be
                    around zero for a random heap of dots (first subplot) as well as for a perfect quadratic
                    relationship (U-shaped subplot). Therefore, a low correlation coefficient should not be
                    mistaken
                    for independence of the variables. To be on the safe side plot your data and make sure
                    it is
                    monotonic (steadily increasing or decreasing), otherwise, the correlation coefficient
                    may not be
                    meaningful.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another thing to keep in mind is that correlation measures association between
                    variables, but
                    association does not necessarily indicate causation. Correlation can be due to pure
                    coincidence
                    or a third, hidden factor (also known as a confounder) that independently affects the
                    observed
                    variables.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's have a look at the formula of Pearson's correlation coefficient to understand what
                    it
                    does. In the numerator and denominator the observations deviations from the point of
                    averages
                    are used.
                    $$r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i -
                    \bar{x})^{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^{2}}}$$

                    The interesting part is happening in the numerator. Let's say we have an observation
                    ($x_{i},
                    y_i$) that is to the right ($x_i &gt; \bar{x}$) and above the point of averages ($y_i
                    &gt;
                    \bar{y}$).
                </p>

                <p>
                    For this observation, we would multiply two positive values $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i -
                    \bar{y})$
                    yielding once again a positive value. Now take an observation to the left ($x_i &lt;
                    \bar{x}$)
                    and
                    below ($y_i &lt; \bar{y}$) the point of averages, both the deviations from the means are
                    negative
                    but due to the negation of the minus sign by multiplication the result of $(x_i -
                    \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$ is positive too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we have observations in the lower-left and upper-right quadrants, the numerator of
                    our
                    equation is positive. Conversely, when we have observations in the upper-left and
                    lower-right
                    corners, the numerator is negative. The denominator standardizes the squared values in
                    the
                    numerator, which limits the resulting coefficient to a range of values between $-1$ and
                    $1$.
                    Imagine you have about the same number of observations sitting in positive and negative
                    quadrants in the plot below, their effect would cancel out and the correlation
                    coefficient
                    amounts to approximately zero. This is why Pearson's correlation coefficient only works
                    with
                    linear relationships.

                <p>
                    Perhaps you can now see why a positive correlation coefficient is obtained when the
                    majority
                    of observations are clustered in the lower-left and upper-right corners, while a
                    negative
                    coefficient is obtained for observations in the upper-left and lower-right areas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The correlation coefficients formula can also be written as:$$r=\frac{s_{x y}}{s_xs_{y}}
                    $$where $s_{x y}=\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$ is the
                    <em>sample covariance</em> which measures the joint variability of $x$ and $y$ while
                    $s_x$
                    and
                    $s_{y}$ are the respective standard deviations that normalize the covariance. The
                    correlation
                    coefficient can thus be understood as a normalized version of the covariance.

                <p>The abovementioned qualities of Pearson's coefficient have interesting implications.
                    Firstly, the
                    relative nature of the coefficient enables comparison between datasets of varying
                    scales.
                    Secondly, it provides the direction of the relationship with mathematical proof.
                    Finally, the
                    value of $r$ provides detailed information about the joint behavior of the two
                    variables. The
                    slope of ($\frac{s_y}{s_{x}}$) only contains insufficient info on joint behavior. But by
                    adjusting the slope of the SD Line with the correlation coefficient we obtain the proper
                    slope
                    of the regression line.<br />
                    $$r*\frac{s_y}{s_{x}}$$<br />
                    A line with this adjusted slope does only change by a certain percentage of the
                    'typical'
                    deviations from the point of averages. The sign tells us if the variables move in the
                    same
                    direction (upward-sloping, positive sign) or in opposing directions (downward-sloping,
                    negative
                    sign). Combining the slope of the SD Line and the correlation coefficient is called the
                    regression method in contrast to the more common method of arriving at a regression
                    parameter
                    namely the method of least squares.

                <h2>Method of Least Squares</h2>
                <p>It is common to express the regression line using the following formula:<br />
                    $$\hat{y}=\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_{1}x+\epsilon$$<br />
                    To draw this line, we start from the intercept $\hat\beta_0$ --the point where the line
                    crosses
                    the $y$-axis -- and then extend the line by moving along the slope of $\hat\beta_1$ for
                    every
                    increment of $x$. Here, the slope $\hat\beta_1$ is the same as the one from the
                    regression
                    method but now derived through the method of least squares.</p>
                <p>The symbols' hats above signify that they are estimates. The function's right-hand side
                    consists
                    of two estimates ($\hat\beta_0, \hat\beta_{1}$), and thus, the outcome $\hat{y}$ is also
                    an
                    estimator for the observed value of $y$. We can evaluate our estimates by measuring how
                    far they
                    deviate from the actual values. The epsilon ($\epsilon$) in the formula represents the
                    combined
                    deviation of our estimates from the actual values. The so-called error term $\epsilon$
                    can be
                    understood as the impact of all unaccounted factors in the regression model.
                </p>
                <p>For one specific estimate we calculate the individual error $\epsilon_i$ as the
                    discrepancy
                    between the predicted value $\hat{y_i}$ and its actual observed value $y_i$ as:<br />
                    $$(y_{i} - \hat{y_i}) = \left[y_{i} - (\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_{1}x_i)\right]$$
                    If you're attempting to fit a straight line to the data, the errors (of prediction) are
                    the vertical
                    distances between the observed and estimated values. In other words, they are the
                    distances between
                    the dots and the line in the plot below.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>The general idea behind the method of least squares is to minimize the overall errors
                    between estimates and observations. Therefore the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is minimized.

                    $$min\left\{\sum[y_i-(\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_{1}x_i)]^2\right\}$$

                <p>Taking the squared errors has two benefits. First of all if we minimize the sum of
                    un-squared errors we might find multiple minima, but it can be shown that there is one (and only
                    one) line for which the SSE is a minimum. More specifically it transforms the minimization problem
                    into a convex optimization problem, allowing for the use of derivatives to determine optimal
                    parameters. Secondly squaring errors accentuates larger deviations, this can potentially
                    prevent overfitting but also lead to over-simplification (generalization versus overfitting).
                </p>
                <p>By optimizing the above function we find the quantities of $\hat\beta_0$ and
                    $\hat\beta_{1}$ that
                    yield the least square error. </p>
                <p>In math it looks like this:<br />
                    $$\text{Find }\min_{\beta_{0}, \,\beta_1} Q(\beta_{0}, \,\beta_1), \quad\quad \text{for
                    }
                    Q(\beta_{0},\,\beta_1) = \sum (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i))^2$$
                    $$\frac{\partial Q(\beta_{0}, \beta_1)}{\beta_{0}}\quad \rightarrow \quad
                    \hat\beta_{0}=\bar{y}-\hat{\beta_1}\bar{x}$$
                    $$\frac{\partial Q(\beta_{0}, \beta_1)}{\beta_{1}}\quad \rightarrow \quad \hat{\beta_1}=
                    \frac{\sum
                    (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^{2}} = \frac{s_{x y}}{s_x^2}$$
                    <br />
                <p> They are called the least squares estimates of the population parameters $\beta_0$ and
                    $\beta_1$,
                    and the prediction equation $\hat{y}=\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_{1}x+\epsilon$ is called the
                    least
                    squares line.</p>
                <p> I have said before that this slope of $\hat\beta_1$ is the same as the one worked out by
                    combining the slope of the SD Line and the correlation coefficient. Here is how they're
                    connected in symbols:<br />
                    $$\hat\beta_1=r \frac{s_y}{s_{x}}=\frac{s_{x y}}{s_{x}\thinspace
                    s_{y}}\,\frac{s_y}{s_{x}} =\frac{s_{x y}}{s_{x}^2}$$<br />
                    where $r$ is the correlation coefficient, $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the sample standard
                    deviations,
                    $s_{xy}$ the sample covariance and $s_x$ is the sample variance of $x$. </p>
                </p>
                <p>Let's see how we find the intercept $\hat\beta_0$. <br />
                    $$\hat\beta_{0}=\bar{y}-\hat{\beta_1}\bar{x}$$<br />
                    It's pretty straightforward, once we have the slope of the regression line we can walk from the
                    point of averages ($\bar x, \, \bar y$) along the regression line towards the point where it
                    intersects with the $y$-axis ($x=0$) this is our intercept $\hat\beta_0$.
