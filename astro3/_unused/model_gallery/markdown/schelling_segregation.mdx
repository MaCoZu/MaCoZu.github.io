# Segregation Model
Economist Thomas Schelling developed the model in the 1970s, demonstrating how a mild inclination of people to live around the same kind can lead to a highly segregated society. From the narrow decisions of individuals emerges an overall pattern of neighborhoods that are more homogeneous than individual preferences suggest.

In the model, each person is represented by a field on a grid surrounded by eight neighbors. When deciding whether to stay or move, a person looks at the percentage of similar people in their vicinity. For example, if someone prefers 30% of their neighbors to be similar to them, they will move if fewer than 3 out of 8 neighbors are of their kind. If there are vacancies and the person has only 6 neighbors, having 2 of their kind around will cause them to stay.

One person moving could induce the next person to leave the neighborhood and eventually trigger a cascade of relocations. The process might easily lead to a situation, where environments are more homogeneous than anybody wished for. These are examples of a tipping point and a subsequent emergent phenomenon. Where abrupt change is happening once the preference level is reached and a large-scale pattern emerges that the individual decisions would not suggest on their own.

To measure segregation we can calculate the index of dissimilarity $DI$. It ranges between zero, or no dissimilarity, and 1, or complete separation of each group from the other. $$DI = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{a_i}{A} - \frac{b_i}{B} \right|$$
- $n$ = Number of neighborhoods
- $a_i$ = Population of group A in neighborhood $i$
- $b_i$ = Population of group B in neighborhood $i$
- $A$ = Total population of group A across all neighborhoods
- $B$ = Total population of group B across all neighborhoods

Dissimilarity is the most widely used measure of evenness. It compares the composition of neighborhoods to the proportion of different groups in the overall metropolitan area. If the single neighborhoods have the same composition as the entire region, the index is close to zero. While a value close to 1 means high segregation. 

As people move they’re reducing the unhappiness with their neighbors. I have added an unhappiness meter to the simulation, showing the percentage of people whose preferences are met. 

More **Measures of Evenness** like the Dissimilarity Index, compare the spatial distributions of different groups.
- The **Gini coefficient** captures overall inequality between areas, taking into account how unevenly groups are spread out *across the entire region*. 
- **Entropy** captures how mixed neighborhoods are, versus overall group separation.

**Concentration** is measured by how much space is occupied by a group. Minority groups of the same relative size occupying less space would be considered more concentrated and consequently more segregated. Furthermore, **Centralization** measures the location of groups relative to a city center, and **Clustering** examines the adjacency of similar groups ([U.S. Census Bureau, 2021](https://www.census.gov/topics/housing/housing-patterns/guidance/appendix-b.html))

The above measures focus on where people live, with the use of smartphones and GPS data less static approaches allow us to analyze movement patterns and “experienced segregation” – the amount of people’s exposure to other groups as they go about their daily lives ([Gorlick, 2020](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2020/08/new-measure-segregation)).

So-called **Measures of Exposure** can determine the degree of potential contact between the minority and majority groups and thus the “experiences” segregation by the minority. Whereby **Interaction** (the exposure of the minority to the majority) and **Isolation** (the extent to which the minority sticks among themselves) can be measured.
